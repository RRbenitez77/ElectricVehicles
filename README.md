This project was started with extracting data from Data.gov
I then took the file to Numbers in Mac and over to Excel to convert to csv file for Jupyter notebooks
Once in Jpytr, i imported a few tools from Seaborn for more estetical charts with more statistical tolls and visualizations and Matplot.
pandas was used for known functionality and ease of use
The File was fairly large in data points including those not needed which dfdrop to exclude unneeded data points for this research.
df.isna was utilized to check for string values
